## Install

```bash
npm install -g aiemu
```

## Usage 

```bash
aiemu
```

1. Enter the game you want to emulate
2. Play the text-based version of the game!

## Setup

AIEMU requires an [Anthropic API key](https://www.anthropic.com/) to function. 

1. Sign up for an Anthropic account 
2. Save your API key to `~/.config/anthropic.token`

## How It Works

AIEMU leverages the game knowledge and reasoning abilities of large language models to dynamically generate a text-based emulation of classic videogames, complete with menus, dialogue, gameplay and even ASCII art visuals.
